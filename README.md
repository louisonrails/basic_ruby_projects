# Basic Ruby Challenges

A collection of basic Ruby programming challenges designed to solidify knowledge in iterations, string manipulation, and working with arrays. This repository contains solutions to classic programming problems, each in its own folder with a solution and corresponding test cases. These challenges help improve fundamental skills in Ruby and serve as a step towards mastering the language.

## Challenges Included

This project covers the following classic programming problems:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Caesar Cipher**
3. **Stock Picker**
4. **Substrings**

### Overview of Challenges

#### 1. Bubble Sort
An implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, where elements are repeatedly swapped to sort an array in ascending order. This challenge helps practice loops and array manipulation in Ruby.

#### 2. Caesar Cipher
A classic encryption method where each letter in a given string is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This challenge improves your understanding of string manipulation and control structures.

#### 3. Stock Picker
A problem that requires finding the best days to buy and sell a stock, given an array of stock prices. The goal is to find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and then selling the stock on different days. This challenge practices working with arrays and conditional logic.

#### 4. Substrings
A problem that involves finding all substrings within a given string that meet certain criteria. This challenge reinforces string manipulation, iteration, and the use of loops and conditions in Ruby.


Each challenge folder contains two subfolders:
- `solution`: Contains the Ruby code that solves the challenge.
- `spec`: Contains the test file(s) for testing the solution.

## Installation

To get started with this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic_ruby_challenges.git
   cd basic_ruby_challenges

2. **Install dependencies (RSpec for testing):**

This project uses RSpec to run tests. You can install the required gems by running: `gem install rspec`

## Running the Tests

To run the tests for any challenge, navigate to the spec folder of that challenge and run:

`rspec <test_file_name> # Example: rspec bubble_sort_spec.rb`
